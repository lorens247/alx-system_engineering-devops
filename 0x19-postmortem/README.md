# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary: Duration of the Outage:

- **Start Time:** October 14, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC)
- **End Time:** October 14, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)

## Impact:

The outage affected the core services of our web application, rendering it inaccessible to 75% of our users globally. Users experienced slow page loading times, and some functionalities were completely unavailable during this period.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 AM (UTC):** The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
- **10:15 AM (UTC):** The engineering team was alerted, and initial investigations began to identify the root cause.
- **10:45 AM (UTC):** Assumptions were made about a potential DDoS attack, leading to investigations into network traffic and firewall logs.
- **11:30 AM (UTC):** Further analysis revealed no signs of a DDoS attack. Attention shifted to application code and database performance.
- **12:15 PM (UTC):** The incident was escalated to senior engineers and the database administration team for more in-depth analysis.
- **1:30 PM (UTC):** The root cause was identified: a database connection leak due to a recent code deployment was causing resource exhaustion and slowing down the entire system.
- **2:00 PM (UTC):** The issue was resolved by fixing the connection leak, and normal system performance was restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced back to a code deployment that inadvertently introduced a database connection leak. This leak led to a gradual exhaustion of available database connections, resulting in slowed response times and eventually a system-wide outage.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team immediately patched the code to fix the connection leak. Additionally, they optimized the database connection pool settings to prevent similar issues in the future. This resolution ensured that the web application regained its normal functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Code Review and Testing:** Implement a rigorous code review process to catch potential issues before deployment. Introduce comprehensive automated tests to identify memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal patterns in real-time. Set up alerts for critical metrics, ensuring swift response to any anomalies.
- **Database Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize database configurations, including connection pool settings, to handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:** Document the incident thoroughly, including the root cause and resolution steps, to facilitate knowledge sharing among team members. Conduct post-incident reviews to enhance collective learning and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Conclusion:

This outage served as a valuable learning experience for our team. By implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures, we aim to bolster our systemâ€™s resilience and minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. Your trust is paramount to us, and we are committed to providing a seamless and reliable user experience.
