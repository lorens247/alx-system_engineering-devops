# Webstack Debugging Series

The Webstack debugging series is designed to train you in the art of debugging. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, it is essential to have the skill to debug a webstack, as computers and software rarely function exactly as intended. Mastering debugging techniques requires practice and experience.

The objective of this series is to provide you with broken or bugged webstacks, and your task is to identify and resolve the issues. Ultimately, you will need to create a Bash script that, when executed, will restore the webstack to a working state. However, before writing the script, it is important to understand the problem and fix it manually.

Let's begin with a simple example. For my server to function properly, it must meet the following requirements:

-   Have a copy of the `/etc/passwd` file located in `/tmp`.
-   Have a file named `/tmp/isworking` that contains the string "OK".

In this scenario, the web application will not function correctly if these two elements are missing.
